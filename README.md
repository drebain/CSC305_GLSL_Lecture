# CSC 305 OpenGL/OpenGP Examples

## Please read before compiling

I have not tested that any of this code builds or runs on anything other than my
personal lab machine running Ubuntu 17.10, so attempting to build it as-is
(especially on Windows) may not work. My recommendation if you have issues is
that you take the c++/glsl code and cmake files from the `apps/` directory, and
insert it into a project that you have set up to build on whatever machine you
are using.

## Description

The examples are documented assuming you will read them in order, so I tried to
explain things with comments only where they are first introduced. You should be
able to follow it as a tutorial by reading the comments.

If you have any questions about the code or you think I made a mistake, please
feel free to open an issue on this repo.
